I’ve attached a file called test-errors.txt which contains the error output from npm run test. These errors are from my test file cdmNextIntakeForm.test.tsx. Please:
	1.	Read the errors from the attached file.
	2.	Explain why the tests are failing.
	3.	Provide me with a corrected full test file.
	4.	Keep all mocks inline, no config changes.
	5.	Ensure coverage stays ≥65%.
