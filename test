Dear [Manager’s Name] and Team,

As my engagement on the [Project Name] is concluding on 3rd September, I would like to formally sign off and hand over my responsibilities. Since I will be on leave on 2nd and 3rd September, today (1st September) will be my last working day on this project.

Over the past months, I have worked on the following, which are now completed:
	•	[Task 1 – e.g., Finalized UI enhancements for Dashboard module]
	•	[Task 2 – e.g., Completed integration with backend APIs for intake form submission]
	•	[Task 3 – e.g., Resolved outstanding defects from UAT cycle]

I have also prepared documentation and shared necessary details for the remaining ongoing activities so the team can continue without interruption.

I sincerely appreciate the support, collaboration, and guidance from both management and teammates throughout this project. It has been a valuable and rewarding experience, and I am confident the team will continue driving it forward successfully.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any clarifications during the transition.
