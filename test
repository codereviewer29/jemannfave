I will provide you with two files from a React + TypeScript project:
	1.	cdmNextIntakeForm.tsx (component)
	2.	<SERVICE_FILE>.ts (service used by the component)

Your task is to:
	•	Write comprehensive unit test cases for both files using Jest and React Testing Library.
	•	Achieve at least 65% coverage (statements, branches, functions, and lines).
	•	Do not change project configs (no edits to jest.config.js, tsconfig.json, or setup files).
	•	All mocking must be done inline inside the test files.
