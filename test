    Environment Provisioning
  </Box>{' '}
  is a key step in migrating data to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It involves automating the setup of GCP
  projects and services by collecting prerequisites from Application &amp; Tenant teams which then submit
  automated requests to sub-teams to provision the necessary GCP resources required for the application
  migration. Once submitted, teams will receive updates (tickets) as provisioning progresses. The
  environmental provisioning will take approximately three (3) weeks to complete.

<Typography sx={{ color: '#333', lineHeight: 1.7, mt: 1 }}>
  The Enablement team then provides documentation or a runbook to guide the use of the newly provisioned GCP
  resources.
